Sandbox for playing with libopencm3 in a nucleo-144 evaluation board

If you forgot to clone --recursive(ly), do this first:

  % git submodule init
  % git submodule update

Once you've pulled in the opencm3 library, you can build it like this:

  % make opencm3

When the library built without error, build the firmware like so:

  % make

To flash the firmware onto a nucleo-144 board:

  % st-flash hello-world.bin 0x08000000

The user LED LD1 should blink after the flasher is done.
